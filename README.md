# Smart-Ghosts
Smart Game Logic-PacMan Ghost Algorithms


This paper aims to describe the process of creating a unique playable and different Pacman game through our development of the “Ghost agents” AI, our algorithm aims to show the importance of the Randomness factor while navigating through a maze, and how some deterministic factors combined with randomness could create a well-balanced environment for a game, the implementation and the process of building an applet, This is an intelligent pacman game written in Java. The original goal of the project is to demonstrate how randomness contributes to the intelligent movements of the ghosts while dealing with the game environment with all of its variables and states, the movement of the ghosts is what makes our game project unique and interesting.
